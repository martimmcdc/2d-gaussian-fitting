### autorun.py ###

The file autorun.py when executed requests by order:
	- the name of the table file (with extension .fits)
	- the folder in which the target images and table are located (with a "/" at the end), 
	- the folder in which the resulting fitted files should be saved (leave as "" to save in the same location as the autorun.py file),  
	- a 1 or 0 number, specifying if you wish to plot the results image for all files (1) or not (0),
	- the fitting radius to be used as a number (by default 4).
