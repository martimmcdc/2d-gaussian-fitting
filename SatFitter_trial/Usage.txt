Usage of the SatFitter code:

In order to run the codes the scripts must be in the same path as the folders containing the data and the output fitted files. 
In case of running the autorun.py file the terminal must be in the same directory as mentioned above, with all the scripts and the target & destination folders. 
These files can be moved to other locations as long as they are always in the same directory as each other and the mentioned folders.

Once assembled the code can be used as long as the script/terminal file is working in the directory of the functions.
