# 2D-Gaussian Fitting

Code suited to fit gaussian surfaces through images.

The programme and functions in this repository were idealized for use in the fixing of saturated images of astronomical objects.
Some scripts for automated image processing are also provided.

An executable standalone version for the automated analysis is also available, for those who don't want to bother with the programming and installation.
